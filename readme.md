## Usage

```
npm i          #Â Install dependencies
npm run build  # Build media-tag and application, creates ./dist with all needed files
npm start      # Start two web servers, one with application and another with assets
```

## Templates

Templates are available in the folder `src/app/templates/`.
The file `src/app/templates/index.js` contains the list that will be
shown inside the editor (with the respective labels).

To add a new template you can create new files inside template
directory and add their references inside the `index.js` file.
Be aware that, with the current configuration, only files
named `*.tpl.html` and `*.tpl.json` are read as strings by the
bundler.

## Roadmap

* Download with assets and HTML sample
* Animations on delete/etc
* Save/load state last navigation
* Fix code format, some es5, some es6
* Refactor dialog store (separate dialog from media)
* Flag different types (now is only string, we need bool, object, etc)
* Upload connectors? For example, connect with other sites APIs to upload oEmbed content
* Update buttons with app/IconButton
* Advanced formatting media (more user friendly for complex formats like videojs)
* Upload login
* Electron
* View/render area update (only work in chrome because webcomponents)
* Add in View controllers for monitor state change
* Upload in other storages
* Upload package or manifest (Today only manifest)
* Hoping that one day [this](https://github.com/reflux/reflux-promise/pull/18) lands
* [BUG] Problem when dragging with view iframe
