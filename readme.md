## Usage

```
npm i          #Â Install dependencies
npm run build  # Build media-tag and application, creates ./dist with all needed files
npm start      # Start two web servers, one with application and another with assets
```

## Roadmap

* Download with assets and HTML sample
* Animations on delete/etc
* Save/load state last navigation
* Fix code format, some es5, some es6
* Refactor dialog store (separate dialog from media)
* Flag different types (now is only string, we need bool, object, etc)
* Upload connectors? For example, connect with other sites APIs to upload oEmbed content
* Update buttons with app/IconButton
* Advanced formatting media (more user friendly for complex formats like videojs)
* Upload login
* Electron
* View/render area update (only work in chrome because webcomponents)
* Add in View controllers for monitor state change
* Upload in other storages
* Upload package or manifest (Today only manifest)
* Hoping that one day [this](https://github.com/reflux/reflux-promise/pull/18) lands
